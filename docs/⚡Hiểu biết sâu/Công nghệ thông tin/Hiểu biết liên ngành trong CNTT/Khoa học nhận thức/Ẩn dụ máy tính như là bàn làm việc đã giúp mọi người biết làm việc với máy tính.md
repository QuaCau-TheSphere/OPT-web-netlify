So before that, all computers were just the command line. You know, you just don't have anywhere to start. And they designed this idea of like, okay, your computer is like your desk and the code on your thing is contained into files, just like your paper on the desk.

[38:34] **Maggie**: And everything about the way we use modern computers is framed around this, this desktop metaphor. I found his name, **Tim Rohrer**. I can't say that. Anyway, he wrote a lot of wonderful papers about the history of internet metaphors and digital metaphors.

[38:48] **Maggie**: And he talked about, in the beginning they had a really hard time getting people to understand how to use the desktop, which to now, us is just.. of course it's intuitive, you know? That's what we say. Of course, you know where the stop button is. Of course, you know how to find files. Who wouldn't know that?
